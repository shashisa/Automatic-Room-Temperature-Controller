# Automatic-Room-Temperature-Controller

Automatic-room-temperature-controller This project is an automatic room temperature controller designed to maintain a comfortable environment by regulating the temperature based on user-defined settings. The system uses sensors to monitor the room temperature and controls heating or cooling devices accordingly.

Features: -Real-Time Temperature Monitoring: Continuously monitors the room temperature using a temperature sensor (e.g., DHT11, DHT22).

-Automatic Control: Automatically turns on/off heating or cooling devices to maintain the desired temperature range.

-User-Defined Settings: Allows users to set the desired temperature range for optimal comfort.

-LCD Display: Displays the current temperature, set temperature, and system status on an LCD screen.

-Energy Efficient: Helps conserve energy by ensuring that heating or cooling devices only operate when necessary.

Components Required:

-Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino, Raspberry Pi)

-Temperature Sensor (e.g., DHT11, DHT22)

-Relay Module

-LCD Display

-Heating/Cooling Devices (e.g., fan, heater)

-Miscellaneous (wires, power supply, etc.)

Connect the circuit as shown in the vedio or image. Make sure you give less supply so that the ardiuno may not blast and also take care of the connections. Maintain good components and set the temperature sensor at the end of the board so that we can change the temperatures easily. Dump the code above in the ardiuno.set a certain cutoff temperature as per your required conditions.
